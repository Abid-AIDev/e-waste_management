QR & E-Waste Management System 🚀

Welcome to the QR & E-Waste Management System, an integrated platform designed for QR code-based tracking and efficient e-waste repair management. This repository contains three main components, each serving a unique purpose:

📂 Project Structure
	1.	QR MVP 🏷️
	•	A Node.js application that allows users to generate QR codes and store details in a CSV file.
	•	Users can also scan QR codes to retrieve and display stored data.
	•	Helps in tracking assets and managing inventory efficiently.
	2.	WMS 4 - E-Waste Generator Dashboard 🔧
	•	A React-based dashboard for entities generating e-waste.
	•	Enables businesses to track repair shops, request repairs, and manage e-waste disposal.
	•	Includes a login system (Username: abid, Password: abid).
	•	After login, it redirects to the Centre Dashboard for further processing.
	3.	Centre - Repair Center Dashboard 🏭
	•	A React-based dashboard used by repair centers to manage repair requests, sales, and inventory.
	•	Helps track incoming e-waste, accept/decline repair requests, and optimize workflow.
	•	Login credentials: (Username: abin, Password: abin).
	4.	Machine Learning Module (PY Folder in WMS 4) 🤖
	•	A Flask-based web app that performs Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest analysis.
	•	Trained on CSV data to generate predictive graphs.
	•	Run using:

cd PY
python app.py
